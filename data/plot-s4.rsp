@
@  Response file for steady state flow sample problem: run 4
@
@  This response file shows the responses necessary to plot a single time step 
@  (time step number 2, which displays the plume after 10 years of releasing 
@  particles). You can plot other time steps by substituting the appropriate 
@  time step number. 
@
@  Another way to plot additional time steps quickly is to edit this response
@  file and add the text string, (?), to the end of the prompt termination
@  lines for the prompts that ask for (1) the title, and (2) the time step
@  number that should be plotted. Whenever MODPATH or MODPATH-PLOT finds the 
@  character string, (?), in a prompt termination line, that prompt is 
@  issued interactively. Otherwise, responses are read directly from the file.
@  In this case, you will be prompted to enter a title and the number of the 
@  time step that you want to plot.
