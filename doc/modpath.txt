NAME
     modpath - A particle-tracking postprocessor model for
     MODFLOW


ABSTRACT
     MODPATH is a particle-tracking postprocessing package that
     was developed to compute three-dimensional flow paths using
     output from steady-state or transient ground-water flow
     simulations by MODFLOW, the U.S. Geological Survey finite-
     difference ground-water flow model.  The particle tracking
     package consists of two Fortran computer codes: (1) MODPATH,
     which calculates particle paths, and (2) MODPATH-PLOT, which
     displays results graphically. MODPATH is useful as a
     visualization tool to help understand flow patterns in
     simulated ground-water flow systems.  It is also useful for
     delineating sources of water to discharge sites and aquifers
     in systems simulated with MODFLOW.

METHOD
     MODPATH uses a semi-analytical particle tracking scheme that
     allows an analytical expression of the particle's flow path
     to be obtained within each finite-difference grid cell.
     Particle paths are computed by tracking particles from one
     cell to the next until the particle reaches a boundary, an
     internal sink/source, or satisfies some other termination
     criterion.  Both steady-state and transient ground-water
     flow systems can be analyzed with MODPATH.

HISTORY
     Version 5.0  2008/11/5 - Allows binary files larger than 2
       gigabytes.  Can automatically detect binary head and budget
       files that are single or double precision.  An option was
       added to track particles outside of the grid as required
       for performing parameter estimation based on travel time.

     Version 4.3 2003/07/03 - Fixed problem that prevented MODPATH
       from working with mixed steady-state and transient stress
       periods.  Fixed problem in which recharge and ET were sometimes
       applied to the wrong cells when COMPACT BUDGET was used.
       Fixed problem with displaying contours.  Added a check for
       negative cell thickness.

     Version 4.2 2001/04/18 - Modified to improve use on personal
       computers.  The code was modified to make it possible to use
       non-standard compiler options for opening unformatted head
       and budget files. This can make it possible for MODPATH and
       MODPATH-PLOT to read head and budget files generated by MODFLOW
       runfiles that were created by a different compiler than the one
       used to compile MODPATH and MODPATH-PLOT.
       Also, a new version of Interacter has been loaded with the PC
       version of MODPATH-PLOT, which supports more graphics devices.

     Version 4.1 2000/07/06 - Modified to work with MODFLOW-2000.
       MODPATH version 4 has been modified to read the cell elevations
       from the MODFLOW-2000 discretization file.  The discretization
       file also defines the number and length of stress periods, so
       this information is no longer read from MODPATH's main data file.

       Another change involves the way MODPATH determines information about
       stresses.  MODPATH versions 3.2 and earlier read the MODFLOW input
       files for stresses.  These were read in order to identify the locations
       of stresses and the faces to which a stress is applied (variable IFACE).
       For the WEL and RCH Packages, the stress input files were also read
       to define the stress flow rate rather than using data in the budget
       file. MODPATH version 4 no longer reads any stress files.
       Instead, the stress information is obtained entirely from
       the budget file.  MODFLOW-2000 has been modified to save AUXILIARY
       variables in the budget file, and MODPATH uses AUXILIARY variable
       IFACE to define the IFACE variable that was previously read from
       the MODFLOW input files for stresses.

     Version 3.2 1999/06/14 - Dynamic memory allocation added to
       allow for very large problems and minimize the need for
       source-code recompilation.  Additional graphical output
       options provided in precompiled MODPATH-PLOT.  Fixed
       problem causing MODPATH to fail when trying to read the
       MODFLOW head file for cases where the MODFLOW-96 XSECTION
       option was used to save the heads as a single 2D cross
       section.  Fixed problem causing end-of-file error when
       reading the cell-by-cell budget file when list-oriented
       stress packages (e.g. rivers, drains, etc.) had zero
       entries for one or more stress periods.  Fixed bug
       causing the automatic particle generation option to fail
       for transient simulations where the number of columns was
       larger than the number of rows.

     1994 - version 3 released (no version 2 was released)

     1989 - version 1 released

DATA REQUIREMENTS
     Data input for MODPATH and MODPATH-PLOT is a combination of
     data files and interactive keyboard input.  Keyboard input
     also can be redirected to a data file.  Both programs are
     designed to work with MODFLOW.  The number of new data files
     required by MODPATH is minimized by making use of MODFLOW
     data files whenever possible.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
     Output from MODPATH is in the form of a variety of numerical
     data files containing spatial coordinates of particles and
     traveltime.  Output from MODPATH-PLOT is primarily graphical.
     The graphical output is dependent on the capabilities of the
     GKS graphics system installed on the computer system.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     MODPATH and MODPATH-PLOT are written in standard Fortran 90,
     and they can be compiled with any standard Fortran 90 compiler.
     In addition to a Fortran compiler, MODPATH-PLOT requires a
     graphics subroutine library known as GKS (Graphical Kernel
     System).  GKS is a standardized set of graphics routines
     that are available commercially for most computer systems.
     The code has been used on UNIX-based computers and on
     Windows-based computers.
